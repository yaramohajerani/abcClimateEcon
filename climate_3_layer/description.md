# Climate 3-layer

This is a closed-world 3-layer supply-chain:
- commodity producers
- intermediary firms
- final goods and services firms.

as well as hosueholds, who both consume from the output of the firms and are employed by the firms.

Acute and chronic physical climate stress will be unequally applied to the firms to examine the macroeconomic effects.

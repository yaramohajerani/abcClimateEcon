# Climate 3-Layer Economic Model

A climate-economics simulation model that captures the effects of climate stress on supply chain production through overhead cost increases rather than direct productivity impacts.

## Model Architecture

### Core Design Philosophy

This model uses an **overhead-based climate impact system** where climate stress manifests as increased business costs (CapEx, legal fees, damages, disruptions) rather than direct productivity reductions. This approach is more realistic as firms rarely lose productive capacity directly, but instead face higher operational costs when dealing with climate-related challenges.

### Agent Types

**Supply Chain Layers (Production)**
- **Commodity Producers**: Transform labor into raw commodities (e.g., agriculture, mining)
- **Intermediary Firms**: Transform labor + commodities into intermediate goods (e.g., processing, manufacturing)
- **Final Goods Firms**: Transform labor + intermediate goods into final consumer goods

**Economic Actors**
- **Households**: Supply labor, consume final goods, accumulate wealth

### Climate Impact Mechanism

The model supports **multiple climate stress modes** that can be configured per agent type and per climate event:

**Overhead Cost Mode (Recommended for Infrastructure/Legal impacts):**
- **Base Overhead**: Fixed operational costs per round (configured per agent type)
- **Current Overhead**: Base overhead multiplied by stress factors from climate events
- **Cost Sharing**: Configurable split between firm absorption vs. customer price pass-through
- **Money Conservation**: Overhead costs absorbed by firms are redistributed to other agents to maintain economic equilibrium

**Productivity Mode (Recommended for Direct Production impacts):**
- **Base Production**: Baseline production capacity
- **Current Production**: Base production multiplied by stress factors from climate events
- Climate stress directly reduces output quantity

**Combined Mode ("both"):**
- Both overhead and productivity impacts can be applied simultaneously
- Each climate event can specify separate stress factors for productivity and overhead
- Enables modeling complex climate impacts (e.g., extreme weather reducing output AND increasing repair costs)

**Stress Types (All Modes):**
- **Acute Stress**: Temporary impacts from discrete climate events with gradual recovery
- **Chronic Stress**: Permanent degradation from long-term climate change

**Enhanced Configuration Options:**
- **Per-Event Stress Modes**: Each chronic rule and shock rule can specify different stress modes
- **Separate Stress Factors**: `productivity_stress_factor` and `overhead_stress_factor` can be configured independently
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy `stress_factor` parameter still supported for existing configurations

**Money Conservation & Redistribution:**
When firms absorb overhead costs (cannot pass to customers), these costs are redistributed throughout the economy:
- **Household Share**: Percentage redistributed to households as income (default: 60%)
- **Firm Share**: Percentage redistributed to other firms as business income (default: 40%)
- **Total Conservation**: All overhead costs are redistributed, maintaining total money supply

**Debt Mechanism:**
Firms facing overwhelming overhead costs or reduced productivity may go into debt if sales cannot cover expenses:
- **Automatic Debt Creation**: When expenses exceed available money
- **Debt Repayment**: Automatic debt reduction when cash becomes available
- **Survival Operations**: Firms continue operating even with debt to maintain supply chains

### Dynamic Pricing System

All prices are calculated dynamically based on actual costs:

**Pricing Formula**: `(input_costs + overhead_shared_with_customers) Ã— (1 + profit_margin)`

- **Input Costs**: Actual labor and material costs from current round
- **Overhead Sharing**: `customer_share` parameter determines how much overhead is passed to customers vs. absorbed by firm
- **No Hardcoded Prices**: Initial prices use simple wage-based estimates; market forces drive all subsequent pricing

### Supply Chain Coordination

The model ensures household survival through cascading minimum production responsibilities:

1. **Household Survival Needs**: Each household requires minimum consumption per round
2. **Final Goods Responsibility**: Each firm calculates their share of total household needs
3. **Intermediary Responsibility**: Based on final goods firms' input requirements
4. **Commodity Responsibility**: Based on intermediary firms' input requirements

This creates automatic supply chain coordination without central planning.
